# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Usage Widget.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-25

First public release.

- Always-on-top, draggable, borderless **Windows** panel (PowerShell + .NET
  WinForms). Zero install, no network, no background service.
- **Today's-total dashboard.** Aggregates every Claude Code session since local
  midnight into one stable view — it never flips between sessions, and resets
  each morning.
- Headline **spent today (cache-aware)** cost, plus a raw **if billed per token**
  figure (every token at full list rate, no cache discount).
- **Daily-tokens gauge** against a tunable budget (`$DailyBudgetTokens`).
- **Per-model rows** (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku / Fable) summed across all of today's
  sessions, sub-agents included.
- Footer: total output tokens, turn count, and the number of distinct sessions
  that contributed today.
- **Incremental byte-offset transcript reader** — live refresh in ~25 ms; cold
  start ~5 s. Re-reads only newly-appended bytes of changed files.
- Single-instance mutex (no duplicate panels), double-buffered + opaque labels
  (no flicker), responsive cold start (placeholders paint before the first scan).
- Right-click menu (Refresh now / Open instructions / Exit), title-bar refresh
  (⟳) and close (×), and position remembered between launches.

### Notes
- Dollar figures are **estimates at API list prices**, not a bill — on a Max/Pro
  plan you pay nothing per token. Read them as a sense of weight.
- The daily-tokens bar is a tunable gauge, **not** your real plan rate-limit —
  that number isn't available to a transcript-only tool.
- Windows only (WinForms + VBS).
